            Nagasaki’s history with the atomic bomb shares a lot of the same tragedy as the one in Hiroshima. However, some key differences make that are highlighted in this city’s recovery. First, since Hiroshima was bombed first, it garnered more global recognition. Hiroshima also experienced a larger death toll, mostly due to the surrounding geography of the two cities. Due to these factors, Nagasaki can be sometimes forgotten about or put in Hiroshima's shadow. It is important to not deflate one of these cities because they had differing encounters with the bomb, each needs to be understood for what happened. Nagasaki is a coastal city, in the southwest of Kyushu. It acted as one of the only trading cities within all of Japan when the country was isolated. For this, Nagasaki has a deep history of trading, shipyards, and being a port city. These identities still play a crucial role in how the city has rebuilt itself.

        <p>
            Catholicism has been a part of Nagasaki since the 16th century when European traders brought their religion in with their goods. This made Nagasaki home to the largest collection of Catholics in Japan. When the atomic bomb was dropped, nearly 2/3 of Nagasaki’s Catholic population was killed.  Additionally, one of the most significant Cathedrals in the city, the Urakami Cathedral, was destroyed being only 500 meters away from the hypocenter. There was a large number of people attending Mass at the time of the explosion burying those inside. The destruction of this cathedral marked a major spiritual loss leaving many in despair. It would be in 1958 when members of the local Catholic community decided to start rebuilding a new Cathedral in the same spot. This marked a turning point for the community as the processes of healing were taking full effect. Today, there are damaged statues from the original church on display as a reminder of what happened to both the Cathedral and the local Catholic community.

        <p>
            When thinking about the human cost of the atomic bombs being dropped, most people tend to think of the Japanese civilians who became victims. Beyond this, there were people there beyond their will who also became victims. This includes both Korean and Chinese people forced into labor as well as American POWs. The Urakami Branch prison held people from all different backgrounds but would still have the same fate as anyone else nearby. The ruins of the prison now sit within the Nagasaki Peace Park, lining a walkway to the park’s central statue. They are integrated into the park to remind us of those who lost their lives but weren’t Japanese. This inclusion marks a stark contrast from Imperial Japan’s views and efforts towards foreign individuals. The inclusion of these ruins within the park adds a place of remembrance for those victims but also displays a healing attitude towards all of those who suffered from the atomic bombs.

            Nagasaki Harbor
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned before, the harbor of Nagasaki has been an integral part of its culture and identity for hundreds of years. These images of the harbor show how much of that was devastated and leveled by the bomb. In the rebuilding process, the harbor itself gave great relief as it allowed for aid to come in more efficiently. The city would see the harbor rebuilt quickly to allow for food, medicine, and other resources to flow in for the victims. Today, the harbor lines some of the most vibrant parts of the city. Acting as one of the best visual displays of Nagasaki’s regrowth, the harbor is now once again very active and bringing in opportunities for the city.

            Like the aerial images of Hiroshima, similarly, viewing Nagasaki allows for a better understanding of the scale and severity of the atomic bombs. In Nagasaki’s case, the bomb detonated within a valley, which would ultimately save thousands of lives. Still, it is evident to see the destruction the bomb left on the city. The surrounding area of the hypocenter was almost completely leveled leaving very little signs of hope. By looking from above today, it becomes clear how the city was able to rebuild itself; moreover, it was able to expand and grow. Many people can call Nagasaki home today because of the resiliency and determination of those who survived. Throughout the city, there are reminders of the atomic bomb as well as calls for peace and abolishing atomic weapons. The atomic bomb will forever be a part of Nagasaki’s history but as it continues to heal it won’t be defined by it.

            When viewing these images, it is important to remember the suffering and death that are connected. These images allow us to see what happened to those that were there from the comfort behind a screen. These images show how a city sent to hell was able to rebuild and heal from the bomb into a city that strives for global peace.
