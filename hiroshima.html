        <p>
            Following August 6, much of Hiroshima laid in rubble. Many people seek refuge in the surrounding areas. Relief efforts were severely unequipped to handle the amount of people in desperate need of water, food, and medicine. Those who were able to go into the city to help survivors were met with radiation levels that would eventually induce radiation poisoning and other fateful illnesses. It would take months for serious relief and rebuilding efforts to take place.

        <p>Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Dome</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Acting as the de facto symbol of both Hiroshima and the atomic bomb events, the surviving dome is one of the best visual displays of the event. Before the bomb, the building stood as the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. On August 6, about 20 individuals were inside. During the rebuilding process, many advocated for the dome to be torn down and replaced as many argued it was a terrible reminder of what had happened. In response, many vocal supporters were arguing for the dome to be kept and maintained as a reminder of what destructive powers the atomic weapons have. Today, the dome is a UNESCO World Heritage Site where people from around the world come today to remember the tragedy and better understand the use of atomic weapons. In the use of healing as a city, Hiroshima has revitalized the dome to be one of remembrance, hope, and education rather than letting it be destroyed and forgotten.

                Aioi Bridge
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <p>
                The Aioi Bridge was the main target for the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The bridge was a major transportation throughput that people, goods, and the military used. The atomic bomb did not destroy the bridge. The Japanese military was able to build support and repairs in the following weeks to allow for relief efforts to move fluidly. The bridge would stand until 1983 when it was replaced by the current bridge that stands in the same place. The bridge today stands as one of the most important in the city. It connects the Hiroshima Peace Park to one of the busiest areas of the city. It also connects the Peace Park to the dome itself allowing visitors to walk freely around the area and see memorials and remnants of Hiroshima before the bomb.  
            </p>
            <p>
                From my perspective, the bridge marks the resiliency of both the Hiroshima People and the city as even the most destructive weapon on the planet couldn’t bring it down. The bridge still stands today connecting people to places and being a part of Hiroshima’s push for global peace.

                    These areal images are one of the best ways to visualize the destruction of the city. In the before images, the city sprawls out. There are many vibrant and diverse neighborhoods where thousands of families live. There are schools, hospitals, restaurants, and much more that will become nothing more then ruble. By viewing before and after it becomes a lot clearer with the scale and severity of the atomic bomb.  Still, by looking through aerial images from today, the city was able to rebuild and even grow. The edges of the city now go much further out. Buildings rise up to account for more people and business that moved into the city. Hiroshima was determined, and still is, to not be confined to the events of the atomic bomb but rather use that as motivation for its future efforts. The city has rebranded to one of peace, promoting a global abolition of nuclear weapons. It didn’t happen quickly, but the city was able to rebuild from ruins into what we see today.

                <p>
                    When the atomic bomb detonated over Hiroshima, it was intended to explode over the Aioi Bridge. However, it was off-target to the northwest. It detonated over the Shima Hospital. Doctors, Nurses, and patients all were killed instantly. The building was turned to rubble. The site would lay empty for a few years as ground zero of the atomic bomb. Come 1948, the hospital was being rebuilt by Dr. Kaoru Shima and still stands to this day. In contrast to the dome which withstood the bomb and stands as a reminder of the events, the Shima Hospital demonstrates how in a place of such suffering people were still determined to come back and rebuild to help others. As the city continued to rebuild in the surrounding area, this hospital would be vital to supporting the communities and ensuring well being of the citizens.

                When viewing these images, it is important to remember the suffering and death that are connected. These images allow us to see what happened to those that were there from the comfort behind a screen. These images show how a city sent to hell was able to rebuild and heal from the bomb into a city that strives for global peace.
