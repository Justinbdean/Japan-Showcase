                In 1945, President Harry Truman stated that he "regarded the [atomic] bomb as a military weapon and never had any doubt it should be used."
            </P>
            <p>
                On July 16, 1945, approximately 210 miles south of Los Alamos, Scientists and military officials would conduct the first-ever nuclear explosion test. The bomb produced 18.6 kilotons of power, which sent both immense heat and shockwaves outwards for miles and created a towering mushroom cloud that peered over the landscape. Gadget, as the scientists would name it, vaporized everything nearby and would turn the surrounding sand into green glass. Following this success, the military ramped up the production of two more bombs with the intent to be dropped on Japan.         
            </p>
            <p>
                Around 2:45 a.m. on August 6, 1945, three B-29 bombers took off from an island 1,500 miles south of mainland Japan. Aboard one of the planes, Enola Gay, was another atomic bomb, morbidly named “Little Boy”. At 8:14 a.m. the plane would arrive over Hiroshima, searching for its target, the Aioi Bridge. One minute later, Enola Gay would drop Little Boy over the city, which fell for about 45 seconds before the bomb's trigger would begin operating. Within a fraction of a second of triggering the bomb produced more force than 15,000 tons of TNT and created a second sun above the city of Hiroshima.        
            </p>
            <p>
                Three days later, on August 9, 1945, another group of plans set out to drop an atomic bomb, this time named “Fat Man”. The planes were headed towards Kokura, a northern coastal city in the Fukuoka Prefecture. When the aircraft arrived, the area was covered in immense clouds and fog. The weather conditions forced the three plans to divert to the backup city of Nagasaki. Around 11 a.m., the planes arrived over Nagasaki. Similarly to Kokura, the city was covered by clouds making the bombing conditions almost impossible. The mission was close to being called off when on a turn around a gap in the clouds appeared at 11:02 a.m. Fat Man was dropped from the plane and exploded over the city producing more than 21,000 tons of TNT.        
            </p>
            <p>
                Within seconds of both bombs being detonated thousands of people were instantly killed. With no warning or chance to evacuate civilians were vaporized or severely burned causing a gruesome scene. Within the coming weeks, escalated by the lack of resources and support, countless more would die of injuries, radiation, and starvation. Both cities became literal hell on earth for those living there. By the end of 1945, roughly 140,000 people died in Hiroshima and 74,000 people died in Nagasaki. Those who were able to survive past 1945 were plagued with cancer, radiation side effects, visible scars, and stigmatization from other Japanese people.

                Through this project, I’m setting out to explore how two cities, both brought to destruction, were able to rebuild themselves, both as a collection of people and as an identity, to bring back hope and further heal their deep wounds. Through this I will be creating series of before, after, and today photo series. These will both help visualize the events that took place but also show to change since then. Beyond this, I will also be exploring the disconnect between those in support of the use of the atomic bomb and my findings.

            <p>
                Years after the war ended, General Leslie Groves, who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb commented "The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended World War II. There can be no doubt of that. While they brought death and destruction on a horrifying scale, they averted even greater losses".
            </p>
            <p>
                This sentiment is commonly shared by those who supported the use of the atomic bomb during World War 2. The line of reasoning excludes the immense scale and excessive effects caused by the atomic bombs. Not only were the weapons able to kill thousands within seconds but it created lingering health effects that still haunt people to this day. 
                These pictures are a way to fully comprehend the gravity of the bomb and allow oneself to make their own opinion of the matter.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The justification for using the atomic bomb comes into question when analyzing the amount of soldiers' lives that were saved. According to author Barton J. Bernstein in the article "A Post-War Myth: 500,000 U.S. Lives Saved", "U.S. military planners estimated that, at most, 46,000 might die in the various possible invasions of Japan". 
                These figures show a drastic disconnect between what the U.S. Government warned could happen, with death tolls ranging above 200,000 soldiers, and what many officials deemed to be more accurate.
